# RustDesk Self-Hosted Environments

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to document and publish various implementations of a self-hosted RustDesk environment, covering both the **server** and **client** configurations.

This project aims to provide clear, step-by-step guides for deploying RustDesk for both personal and work use cases across a variety of systems, including different operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.) and hardware platforms.

## Current Guides

*   **[Arch Linux / Omarchy Linux with Docker](https://github.com/Antonio-Parada/Rust-Desk/blob/guide/omarchy-arch/RUSTDESK_SERVER_ARCH_LINUX.md)**: A detailed guide for setting up the RustDesk server in a Docker container on an Arch-based Linux system. (Maintained in the `guide/omarchy-arch` branch).
